Classifying network intrusions by using machine learning algorithmns like naive bayes, random forest, decision tree,logistic regression.

## Install
This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
### Code
Code for the project is provided in the intrusion detection using machine learning jupyter notebook.
### Dataset
Dataset used for the intrusion detection is NSL_KDD which consists of selected records of KDD complete dataset.In the dataset there are 24 different types of classes where 23 classes contains some kind of suspicious activity and remaining one class contains normal kind of activity and the classification of different types of attacksis based on 41 features for each connection. This dataset is alphanmeric in nature.
